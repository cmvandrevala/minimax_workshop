# Minimax Workshop

This is the source code that will accompany my slides for the minimax workshop. Although this particular project is written in Elixir, you can certainly write the minimax algorithm in any language of your choice.

## Setting Up the Project

1. Install [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) on your system.
1. Clone this repo
1. Run `mix deps.get`

## Viewing the Source Code

I have tried to break apart each step of building the minimax algorithm on a commit-by-commit basis. If you want to go to a specific step, you can use:

```
git checkout <COMMIT_HASH>
```

## Running the Tests

You can run the test suite via mix:

```
mix test
```
